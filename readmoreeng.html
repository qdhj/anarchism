<p>So, boy, girl, or my non-binary friend, if you are just starting your anarchist study, this page is for you. Here I have listed everything that, in my opinion, is worth your attention. The list is sometimes updated. The books are listed in all the languages that I could find.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Literature:</strong><br></span><br><strong>"Between Peasants"</strong> <em>(Malatesta Errico)</em>&nbsp;is the shortest introduction to anarchism (even shorter than mine!). An interesting presentation in the form of a dialogue between two peasants. Read in one evening. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-between-peasants">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/erriko-malatesta-krestyanskie-rechi">rus</a>)<strong><br><br>"A Brief System of Anarchism in Ten Conversations"</strong> <em>(Malatesta Errico)</em> is a pamphlet book that can be read in two evenings! Runs through all the basic ideas of anarcho-communism, but in more detail than the one above. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-at-the-cafe">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/erriko-malatesta-kratkaya-sistema-anarhizma-v-desyati-besedah">rus</a>)<br><br><strong>"Anarchy Works"</strong> <em>(Peter Gelderloos)</em> is a pretty big book that reveals anarchism in the form of questions and answers. "Aren't people inherently selfish?" "Isn't domination and power natural?" "How will decisions be made?" "Who wants to work without pay?" "But people need bosses and experts?" -- that's exactly what Peter answers (and hundreds of other questions). In fact, this is probably the best anarchy book I've ever read. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/piter-gelderloos-anarhiya-rabotaet">rus</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Bolo'Bolo"</strong>&nbsp;<em>(P.M.)</em> is a nice, medium size book about the "cultural revolution": what does a truly <em>socially free</em> world look like? The author tells how to achieve anarchism in just five years, "if we all start now". (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/p-m-bolo-bolo">eng</a>, <a href="https://ru.theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bolo-bolo">rus</a>)<br><br><strong>The Anarchist Library</strong> is not a book. This is a site that has a huge number of various articles, as well as every book that was mentioned here. Check it out!</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Movies:</span></strong></p>
<p></p><p><strong>"Land and Freedom"</strong> (1995). A wonderful, touching film about the Spanish Revolution. The film shows the brave struggle of the people for the great idea. In addition to the beautiful picture, many of the real features of anarchism are also expressed here: people now and then discuss and vote instead of deciding one for all; the senior in rank "convinces" the soldier of the cost of something, instead of a rude order to "do so", and so on. But the quality of the movie on the Internet is shit...<br><br><strong>"Anarchists"</strong> (2005). Quite an interesting art-house film about French anarchists (remarkably, those who lived after the Paris Commune). The protagonist is a policeman implanted in a gang of anarchists for the sake of surveillance. It does not so much reveal the ideas of anarchism as it tells specifically about the relationship between the characters. I would advise watching it to those who have already figured out the theory.<br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">And those I <strong>do not</strong> recommend:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><strong>"What to do in case of fire?"</strong> is a film about some rebel boys who blow up buildings for fun and then get themselves in trouble, lol. There is very little about anarchism. I do not recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>"The Anarchist Cookbook"</strong> is literally anti-anarchist. I do not recommend it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Movements:</strong></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is worth joining movements, firstly, local ones. If you live eg. in Finland, study finnish anarchist movements; there is at least one of them in almost every city.&nbsp;You can find about anarchism also a lot in social media, eg. Instagram.</p>
